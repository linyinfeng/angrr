# angrr - Auto Nix GC Roots Retention

If you are a heavy user of [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv), you might find that auto GC roots of projects not accessed for a long time won't be automatically removed, leading to many old store paths can not being garbage collected.

This tool simply deletes auto GC roots based on the **modification time(last modified date)** of their symbolic link target.

## Usage

- For non-root users:

  The following command deletes all auto GC roots older than 7 days owned by the current user.

  ```bash
  nix run github:linyinfeng/angrr -- run --period 7d
  ```

- Manage GC roots for all users as the root user:

  The following command deletes all auto GC roots older than 7 days owned by all users.

  ```bash
  sudo nix run github:linyinfeng/angrr -- run --period 7d --owned-only=false
  ```

  The following command deletes auto GC root links in `/nix/var/nix/gcroots/auto` instead of the symbolic link target of the roots.

  ```bash
  sudo nix run github:linyinfeng/angrr -- run --period 7d --remove-root
  ```

Use the `--dry-run` option to have a try.
Use the `--help` option for more options.

For the syntax of `--period <PERIOD>`, please refer to [the documentation of humantime::parse_duration](https://docs.rs/humantime/latest/humantime/fn.parse_duration.html).

## Flake Usage

An overlay `overlays.default` and a NixOS module `nixosModules.angrr` is provided. Run `nix flake show` for more outputs.

A NixOS module example:

```nix
{ ... }:
{
  nix.gc.automatic = true;
  services.angrr = {
    enable = true;
    period = "2weeks";
  };
}
```

This configuration will automatically trigger angrr before `nix-gc.service`,
and the retention period is 2 weeks,
the `--owned-only=false` option will be passed by default so that the service manages auto GC roots for all users.

Read [nixos/module.nix](./nixos/module.nix) for more information.
